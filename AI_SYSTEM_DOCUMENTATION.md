**Purpose**: Provides legal consultation tailored to Kenyan law

**Key Features**:
- Context-aware conversations with legal knowledge
- Citations from Kenyan legal documents
- Chat history and conversation management
- Token usage tracking per conversation

**How it works**:
1. User asks a legal question
2. System searches knowledge base for relevant Kenyan legal documents
3. AI generates response using OpenAI + retrieved legal context
4. Response includes citations and confidence scores
5. All interactions are tracked for usage analytics

### 2. Document Analysis (`document-analysis.ts`)
**Purpose**: AI-powered analysis of user-uploaded legal documents

**Analysis Types**:
- **Summary**: Comprehensive document overview
- **Legal Review**: Legal validity and enforceability check
- **Risk Assessment**: Identification of legal risks
- **Compliance Check**: Kenyan regulatory compliance verification
- **Contract Analysis**: Contract terms and conditions review

**Process Flow**:
1. User uploads PDF/DOCX/TXT document
2. Text extraction and preprocessing
3. Legal context retrieval from knowledge base
4. AI analysis using specialized prompts
5. Structured output with insights, risks, and recommendations
6. Legal citations and relevant statutes provided

### 3. Stepwise Contract Generation (`contract-generation.ts`)
**Purpose**: Guided contract creation with AI assistance

**Features**:

### 4. Knowledge Base (RAG) (`vector-knowledge-base.ts`)
**Purpose**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Kenyan legal knowledge

**Components**:
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for semantic search
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
- **Documents**: Kenyan constitution, acts, case law, regulations
- **Fallback Search**: Text-based search when vector search fails

**How RAG Works**:
1. Legal documents are chunked and embedded
2. User queries are embedded using same model
3. Semantic similarity search retrieves relevant chunks
4. Retrieved context enhances AI responses
5. Citations and sources are provided

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AI Configuration (`config.ts`)
**Model Management**:
```typescript
Models Supported:
- gpt-4-turbo: Complex legal analysis, contracts
- gpt-4: General legal consultation

- text-embedding-3-large: Knowledge base embeddings
```

**Cost Optimization**:
- Automatic model selection based on complexity
- Token usage monitoring and limits
- Per-user subscription-based quotas

### Monitoring & Analytics (`monitoring.ts`)
**Performance Tracking**:
- Response times and success rates
- Error logging and categorization
- System health monitoring
- User activity analytics

**Error Handling**:

- **ai_performance_metrics**: System performance tracking
- **ai_error_logs**: Error monitoring and debugging

## 🚀 How to Train and Update the AI Knowledge Base

### For Administrators (Knowledge Base Management)

#### 1. Adding New Legal Documents
```typescript
// Using the admin API
POST /api/admin/knowledge
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
  file: [PDF/DOCX file],
  metadata: {
    title: "Employment Act 2007",
    category: "statute",
    document_type: "act",
    jurisdiction: "Kenya",
    act_number: "No. 11 of 2007",
    keywords: ["employment", "labor", "workers rights"]
  }
}
```

#### 2. Bulk Document Upload
```typescript
// Upload multiple documents at once
const results = await knowledgeAdmin.bulkUploadDocuments([
  { file: act1.pdf, metadata: {...} },
  { file: case1.pdf, metadata: {...} },
  // ... more documents
]);
```

#### 3. Document Categories
- **Constitution**: Kenyan Constitution
- **Statutes**: Acts of Parliament (Employment Act, Companies Act, etc.)
- **Case Law**: Court decisions and precedents
- **Regulations**: Statutory instruments and regulations
- **Policies**: Government policies and guidelines

#### 4. Quality Control
- Automatic duplicate detection using content hashing
- Content validation (minimum word count)
- Metadata consistency checks
- Admin review workflow

### Training Process

#### Step 1: Document Preparation
1. Ensure documents are in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format
2. Verify document authenticity and currency
3. Prepare accurate metadata (court, date, jurisdiction, etc.)

#### Step 2: Upload and Processing
1. Documents are uploaded via admin interface
2. Text is extracted and preprocessed
3. Content is chunked for optimal retrieval
4. Embeddings are generated and stored in vector database
5. Full-text search indexes are created

#### Step 3: Validation and Testing
1. Test search functionality with sample queries
2. Verify AI responses include relevant citations
3. Check for accuracy and completeness
4. Monitor performance metrics

#### Step 4: Continuous Improvement
1. Monitor user interactions and feedback
2. Identify knowledge gaps
3. Add new documents to fill gaps
4. Update existing documents when laws change
5. Retrain embeddings periodically

### RAG Optimization

#### Chunk Strategy
- **Size**: 1000 characters with 200 character overlap
- **Splitting**: Respects sentence boundaries
- **Metadata**: Preserves document context

#### Search Enhancement
- **Hybrid Search**: Vector + text search combination
- **Contextual Filtering**: Filter by jurisdiction, legal area
