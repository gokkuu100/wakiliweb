# AI-Guided Contract Creation System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

Your approach for creating an AI-guided contract SaaS is **excellent and well-architected**! Here's what I've implemented to enhance your existing foundation:

## âœ… What You Had Right

1. **Template-Based Structure**: Your `nda_template_ai_guided.jsx` shows solid foundation
2. **Database Schema**: Your `solitary_haze.sql` is comprehensive with proper contract lifecycle management
3. **Kenyan Law Focus**: Proper jurisdiction and legal framework consideration

## ðŸš€ Enhanced Implementation

**Example Usage**:
```jsx
<EnhancedNDATemplate
  contractId={contractId}

  selected_clauses: clauseConfig,
  parties: [disclosingParty, receivingParty],
  value_amount: 1000000,
  value_currency: "KSH"
});
```

#### Signature Workflow

// Sign contract
await contractService.signContract(contractId, partyId, userId, signatureData);
```

#### PDF Generation & Download
